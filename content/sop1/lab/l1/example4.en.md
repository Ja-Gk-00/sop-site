# L1: Ἡ Βιβλιοθήκη τῆς Ἀλεξάνδρειας

It is the third century BC. Callimachus of Cyrene (Καλλίμαχος ὁ
Κυρηναῖος) has just completed his famous Pinakes (Πίνακες), a vast
catalogue of hundreds of thousands of scrolls in the Library of
Alexandria, in 120 volumes. It took an enormous amount of work, but as
you might expect, such a large catalogue is still inconvenient to use.
Callimachus is undeterred and is already thinking about another
improvement to the Library's resource indexing. For this, he plans to
use the latest achievement of Hellenic technology: a computer running
Λίνουξ operating system.

Callimachus will enter information about the scrolls into the computer.
Your task is to write a program that runs on Λίνουξ and uses the ΠΟΣΙΞ
API to create the appropriate indexes.

Remember to release all unused resources (memory and file descriptors),
check system function errors, and follow good programming practices.

Stages:

1. At this stage, the program takes one argument: the path to a file
   containing metadata for a book in the library. The metadata uses a
   simple format: each line contains a `key:value` pair. You may assume
   there are no extra `:` characters on a line, but you must handle other
   invalid input. Read the file and print the values of the `author`,
   `title`, and `genre` fields, in that order. If a field is missing,
   print `missing!` for it. For example, given a file containing:

       uthor:Plutarch
       latin_title:De fluviorum et montium nominibus et de iis, quae in illis inveniuntur
       title:Περὶ ποταμῶν καὶ ὀρῶν ἐπωνυμίας
       genre:geography
       incipit:When Chrysippe, through the anger of Aphrodite
       had fallen into a yearning
       for Hydaspes

   the program should print:

       author: missing!
       title: Περὶ ποταμῶν καὶ ὀρῶν ἐπωνυμίας
       genre: geography

   (The first line contains a typo, so the program does not find the
   `author` field.)

   *Hint*: The standard library provides many useful functions for this
   kind of parsing, such as `getline`, `strchr`, `strcmp`, and `strdup`.

   *Hint 2*: We will need this functionality again later, though not
   immediately, so it is best to put it in a separate function.

2. Callimachus's database mirrors the physical structure of the Great
   Library in its directory tree. Nested directories represent the
   building's wings, rooms, shelves, racks, chests\... At the end of
   this hierarchy are regular files whose names reflect the titles
   written on the outside of the scrolls (which need not match the actual
   book titles in the metadata).

   Modify the program so it no longer takes arguments. When run, it
   recursively searches the `library` directory. All regular files
   represent books. Create an `index` directory in the program's current
   directory (report an error if it already exists). Inside it, create a
   directory named `by-visible-title`. Put relative symbolic links there
   to all the books (files) in the library, using their names but without
   their nested directory structure. If any name is repeated, report an
   error.

3. Create two new indexes alongside `by-visible-title`.

   - The `by-title` index is similar to the one from the previous stage,
     but uses the `title` metadata field as the filename. If the field is
     missing, skip the file. If the title is longer than 64 bytes,
     truncate it to that length.

   - The `by-genre` index places books in subdirectories of the form
     `index/by-genre/<genre>`, where `<genre>` is the value of the
     `genre` metadata field. Use the book's metadata title as the
     filename, as above. Truncate the `genre` value to 64 bytes if
     necessary.

4. The final index feature is checking that no books are missing. Another
   programmer has already created a file containing a list of all the
   books in binary format. At this stage, if provided, the program's
   first argument is the path to this database file. Read its contents
   and check that no books are missing. The database format is as follows:
   it contains some number of entries, each consisting of 4 bytes
   representing the file size (`unsigned int`) and the first 64 bytes of
   the title (from the metadata). If the title is shorter than 64 bytes,
   the field is padded with zeros, so each entry is always 68 bytes; the
   number of entries can be determined from the file size. Scan the
   library. For every missing book, print `Book "<title>" is missing`;
   if the file size does not match, print
   `Book "<title>" size mismatch (<expected size> vs <file size>)`.
   Use `readv` to read the database. Use the `by-title` index to check
   whether books are missing.

   The starter files contain two example databases. The first,
   `database_correct`, contains all books in the `library` directory. The
   second, `database_missing`, contains additional books, so the check
   should report an error.

   *Hint*: To ensure the string is always null-terminated, you can use a
   65-character array in the structure representing a single book and set
   the last character to zero. This way, even if the title has been
   truncated to the full 64 bytes, the string will still be
   null-terminated after reading it.
